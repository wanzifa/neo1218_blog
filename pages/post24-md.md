	The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
	
	Beautiful is better than ugly.
	Explicit is better than implicit.
	Simple is better than complex.
	Complex is better than complicated.
	Flat is better than nested.
	Sparse is better than dense.
	Readability counts.
	Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
	Although practicality beats purity.
	Errors should never pass silently.
	Unless explicitly silenced.
	In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
	There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
	Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
	Now is better than never.
	Although never is often better than *right* now.
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
	Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!


	python之禅 ， neo1218译

	美丽胜于丑陋。
	直率胜于含糊。
	简单胜于复杂。
	复杂胜于难以理解的代码。
	段块胜于嵌套。
	稀少胜于稠密。
	可读性才最重要。
	异常代码还不足以打破规则的天牢。
	为了实用需要牺牲。
	不能让错误静静的离开。
	除非我愿如此。
	面对歧义的面具,拒绝猜测的诱惑。
	你要相信,完美的道路只有一条，就是最明显的那个。
	如果你不是造物主,你可能还在寻找。
	现在总比没有好。
	没有总比立刻好。
	难以解释的实现是一个坏想法。
	易于理解的实现或许才是好办法。
	命名空间很棒，让我们做的更多吧!
